## JavaScript is a Prototype based language.
classes feature was introduced in js after ES6 update in 2016.
-> its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanism.
so classes and objects are there but they are just prototypes behind the scene and this become 
possible only cuz of prototype based nature of js. 

# OOP 
    - i know this
# parts of OOP :
    # constructor function
    # prototype
    # classes
    # instances (new , this keyword of particular instance) : object.
    # object literal : is literally nothing : just creating a object. 

# this keyword always refers to current context : context of block inside which it is being used.
