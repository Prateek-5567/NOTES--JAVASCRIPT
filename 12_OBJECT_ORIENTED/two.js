/* new Date() is calling the constructor function of the built-in Date class and returning a new object.
In JavaScript, anything you call with new must be a constructor function
    (traditional function or ES6 class).
Date is a built-in constructor function.
new Date() â†’ allocates a fresh object, sets up its prototype chain, and calls the constructor 
    logic to initialize it with the current time.
